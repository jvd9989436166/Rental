## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors
Edit Tailwind config in HTML files:
```javascript
tailwind.config = {
    theme: {
        extend: {
            colors: {
                primary: { 500: '#YOUR_COLOR' }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Add More PGs
Edit `db.json` or `js/search.js` mockPGData array.

### Modify Animations
Edit `css/styles.css` keyframes and classes.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Mock Authentication**: Currently uses localStorage. Replace with Firebase for production.
2. **Mock Payment**: Razorpay integration is simulated. Add real API keys for production.
3. **Static Data**: PG listings are hardcoded. Connect to real database for production.
4. **No Image Upload**: Image upload UI ready but needs backend implementation.

All these are **ready to integrate** with real backends!
